CMPG323-Overview Repo --->Main Branch--->Project 1---Project 2--->Project 3--->Project 4--->Project 5
This text diagram represents the 5 projects that have been branched from the main branch in the repository. These branches are set and placed in such a way that the projects don't influence each other such as when details Project 3 have been set they will not be able to influence Project 4. The branches can only be affected when they are pushed pr pulled.


this is the method used as a branching strategy for the projects:
One repository has multiple branches and projects can be individually edited.
